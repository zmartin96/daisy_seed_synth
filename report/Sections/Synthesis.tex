\section{Synthesis Details}

\subsection{Oscillators}
Two oscillators provide different waveforms that can be blended together. The first is often a sine wave, the second a sawtooth.

\subsection{Filter}
An SVF filter is applied to the blended signal. Cutoff and resonance are user-controlled.

\subsection{Envelope}
An ADSR envelope shapes amplitude over time, modifiable via six knobs. Velocity and envelope shape add dynamic response.

\subsection{LFO}
The LFO can modulate gain or filter cutoff. Rate, depth, target, and shape are user-configurable.
