\section{Introduction}
The goal of this project is to implement a flexible, extensible synthesizer interface using the Daisy Seed embedded audio platform. Leveraging modular software design and a straightforward hardware control layout, the system empowers users to shape sound in real time through tactile, mode-sensitive parameter control. Multiple interaction modes allow the same physical interface to control different aspects of sound generation, making the most of limited hardware while providing a rich user experience.
